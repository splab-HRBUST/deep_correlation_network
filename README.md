# Deep Correlation Network for Synthetic Speech Detection  
a deep correlation network (DCN) is proposed to learn the latent common information between different embeddings. It consists of two parts, the bi-parallel network and the correlation learning network. Bi-parallel networks consist of different neural models to learn the middle-level representations from front-end acoustical features. The correlation learning network is the core part of the DCN and is proposed to explore the common information between the above middle-level features.
